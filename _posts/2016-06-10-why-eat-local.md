  Most of us give little thought to what we eat. We may try to eat healthy, or
  organic, or read labels to ensure we don’t get too much sodium. But we usually
  don’t understand that how we eat and where we dine or buy our groceries is a
  huge opportunity to have a very positive impact on us and on our community.

Most of us give little thought to what we eat. We may try to eat healthy, or organic, or read labels to ensure we don't get too much sodium. But we usually don't understand that how we eat and where we dine or buy our groceries is a huge opportunity to have a very positive impact on us and on our community. 

There are numerous benefits to a healthy local food system. Local food is fresher, picked just before being sold. Smaller scale growers can select more varieties of vegetables and fruits to grow, resulting in diverse selection. Local Food often taste better and it is much easier to get kids to eat vegetables that taste great. 

The most significant opportunity for local food is the economic benefits to our community. These benefits are far reaching and touch our urban and rural communities and the thousands of people that work in our food industry. 

To fully realize the opportunity we have, we need to understand some basic things about our food system. Our entire food system has many pieces, these pieces work together to get our food from the people that grow it or make it to the people that eat it. 

Some of the pieces of our food system include: farmers & other primary producers, food processors, distributors, retailers, and food service. 

Within our large food system, there are two parallel systems. A local food system and a global food system -- each of which have different costs and benefits. 

We have local farmers, food processors, distributors, retailers and restaurants and we have global farmers, food processors, distributors, retailers and restaurants. An easy way to identify local and global is by asking ourselves: Is this business just in my community, or is it spread across our country, North America, or the world. 

Our goal should be ensuring these two pieces work together to ensure we have the best of both systems: 

* a diverse, healthy and abundant diet
* reliable and affordable access to food
* maximum economic impact for food dollars spent in our community 

The dollars we spend in our local food system work much harder for our local economy. Emerging research is clearly demonstrating that the economic impact is significantly higher for our community compared to our global food system. 

The average Canadian farmers has moved from an average income in the mid 1970s of about $33,000 to losses of $10,000 per year in 2007\. 

In 2007, Alberta consumers spent $9.9 billion dollars in supermarkets and grocery store and 6.6 billion dollars in food service and drinking establishments. 
> 
> A study in Puget Sound looked at the impacts of shifting our food dollars from the Global Food system to the local food system. "The report describes the dollar flows and economic linkages of food-related businesses in the Central Puget Sound region of Washington State. The analysis shows that locally directed spending by consumers more than doubles the number of dollars circulating among businesses in the community. This means that a shift of 20% of our food dollars into locally directed spending would result in a nearly half billion dollar annual income increase in King County alone and twice that in the Central Puget Sound region." 

How can we make Alberta's $17.5 billion dollars of food spending work harder for our community? We can shift more of our food spending to our local food system. 

How can we shift some of our foods spending to our local food system? There are hundreds of ways, but here are a few of the easiest ones: 
> 
> * Visit the farmers market and buy your groceries 
> 
> * Find a farmer and buy direct from a farmer 
> 
> * Dine in independent local restaurants 
> 
> * Become familiar with local brands, we have hundreds 
> 
> * Visit neighborhood bakeries Find an independent meat shops 
> 
> * Find a local coffee shop 
> 
> * Find a local coffee roaster 
> 
> * Have local food delivered to your door 
> 
> * Find a local beer you like or a local wine. 
> 
> * Visit a local and independent wine shop 
> 
> * Localize imports by buying them at a local independent retailer 
> 
> * Talk about the great local food experiences you find -- often the challenge for local businesses is getting the word out 

Currently Local food makes us a small portion of our food spending, likely less than 10%. If we were successful in shifting an additional 20%, it would change the way our community looks.
