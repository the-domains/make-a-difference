![Everyone has different reasons for buying at the farmers market, or going to a local bakery or meat shop.   Here are 10 that resonate with me.](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/0ab454f413305f97bc73c1b1bc5d79161bd9cef2.jpg)

Why Eat Local?

1 - Freshness - products picked and grown close to home are usually fresher

2 - Increased Flavour - local growers don't need to ship thier produects long distances, that mean they can grow varieties that have more flavour but might not be good for storing or shipping

3 - Diversity of products - ever been to a grocery store that had half a dozen different kinds of cauliflour or 20 different potatoes? Me neither - but you can see them at the market all the time

4 - Increased Local Economic Impact - shopping with a local business (includign farmers! - yes they are businesses) can significantly increase the econmic impact of your food purchase to our community

5 - Increased regional Food Security - when we buy local food, farmers and processors can increase how much they grow or make, this increases the level of food production in our region. That is a good thing!

6 - Shorter Supply Chain = less shipping and less shipping means less pollution from trucks or ships or airplanes

7 - You know the Environmental Standards of the producing county - Alberta and Canada have high environmental standards for food producing and growing and food processing has to meet rigourus regulation. That is not the case in other parts of the world, including countries that Canada imports food from

8 - Community building opportunities around food and food culture - farmers markets, food festivals, long table dinners, independent restaurants and food trucks all help provide some "flavour" to our community. Our food culture helps make our community unique and special

9 - Diverse ownership makes the industry competitive - if you have dozens of businesses competing for your dollars, it makes the industry more competitive. (yes farms are businesses)

10 - Local owners or farmers can be held accountable for business practices - if you have a question or concern, the business owner is available, and often the person you are dealing with, so you can get questions answered and have any concerns addressed
