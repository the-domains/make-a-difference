<article style=""><h1>Economic impact of local merchants compared to retail chains</h1><p>“Why would I pay more for a book at a local bookstore, when I can get exactly the same book online for way cheaper?”</p></article>

I was at a meeting in Austin, Texas several years back when I asked this question:

> Why would I pay more for a book at a local bookstore, when I can get exactly the same book online for way cheaper? 

Little did I know, I was asking Steve -- the owner of [BookPeople][0] in Austin. He had been involved in this study a few years earlier and he generously took the time to explain the economic impacts of local business to me.

The study, entitled "Economic Impact Analysis: A Case Study -- Local Merchants vs. Retail Chains", was done by [Civic Economics][1] and is one I reference often. If you visit their site, they have dozens of Economic Impact Studies related to local business.
