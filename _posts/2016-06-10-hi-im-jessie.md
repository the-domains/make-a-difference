Hi - I'm Jessie

I hope this site will help you make a difference in your community.

For the past 15 years, I've been working on increasing community prosperity and vibrancy in Edmonton, Alberta Canada 

I focus on transforming my community by supporting local independent business growth and advocating for regional food system development. I do this by initiating and supporting strategic community projects, leveraging the scale of anchor institutions and shifting citizen buying power. 

This site holds resources, examples and stories of interesting projects that might help spark imagination on how you can help transform your community. 

Some are projects I have been involved in, others are projects or people that I have been inspired by, or have shaped my work

I also have a huge interest in food and a love of restaurants. I've spent about 30 years working in foodservice and I believe successful restaurants can be an effective tool for community revitalization and placemaking. 

If you have a project you would like support on, - please reach out - jessieradies at(@) gmail.com
