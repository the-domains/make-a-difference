Going "Local" is a great way to make a difference in your community, and many families are looking for ways to shift spending to their neighbourhood. There are many reasons for this trend. They could include Social Justice, Environmental or Economic reasons.

Here are some easy steps to assist you to localize, pick the easiest points first & If you have questions or comments or suggestions, please let me know

Localize your home - rent from a local landlord or take a mortgage from a community bank

Live in Local Style - Use local materials for your home and if you are building, use a local architect & builder, great furniture can be found from local artisans or from locally owned retailers

Minimize Automobiles - use your vehicle less by walking, biking, carpooling, using mass transit and living in "Walkable Communities"

Fuel Up Locally - make your car very fuel-efficient, use local fuels when they are available and gas up at a locally owned gas station

Local Car Service - find a good local independent mechanic that you trust and who charges reasonable rates. Use the local car wash, auto parts store and a local insurance agency

Dine Local - avoid chain restaurants

Buy Fresh and Local - Link up with local farmers; rediscover local bakers, cheese makers, butchers, chefs and caterers

Support Local Retailers - be loyal to competitive local pharmacies, bookstores, hardware stores, service providers, gift shops, and clothing retailers. When you need something, there is a local retailer that can supply it.

Play Local - spend more time at local sporting events, playgrounds, parks, films and plays.

Heal Local - use local doctors, dentist, therapists and alternative healers.

Minimize Household Energy use - do the 101 things that you know that reduce your need to purchases of energy. If possible, become a micro generator of power and sell your energy back to the grid
