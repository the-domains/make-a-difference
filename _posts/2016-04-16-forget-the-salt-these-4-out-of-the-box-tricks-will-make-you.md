  Local restaurants could be a huge opportunity for local growers and food
  processors. If you are thinking about growing your business into the
  restaurant market here are a few pointers – from the buyer’s perspective.


  Do not call restaurants at random. Find specific restaurants that might need
  your product and target those.

  If you already sell to restaurants, let the chef know. Name names. Knowing
  that you sell to other restaurants makes us more comfortable in dealing with
  you.

  Find out the chef’s and the owner’s names.  The chef is the person who usually
  makes the decisions on what to buy. These people are frequently the same
  person in small restaurants.

  Go on a slow day – Tuesday or Wednesday – in the mid afternoon.  Do not call
  over lunch, dinner or on Fridays or Saturdays.

  You need to get your product in the mouth of the chef. Go to the restaurant
  with a sample of your product, a small sample, preferably ready to eat.

  We want flavour. We know it is hard to make great tasting food with
  ingredients that don’t taste great.

  If your product requires cooking, take you product cooked – do not season or
  flavour it, but a little salt is OK. Remember, you are not selling a dish, you
  are selling an ingredient, and the chef need to taste what you are selling,
  not taste what s/he can do with it.

  Try and understand your market and their needs. Small high-end restaurants
  need small amounts of specialty products. High volume casual are going to need
  large amounts of cost effective product.

  Most chefs do not want the bulk of their products on Saturday. We need the
  products in the restaurant Wednesday or Thursday so we can prep them for our
  busiest days.

  If all else fails, make a reservation and take a sample of you product. Go in
  for dinner (on a slow day) and ask to speak to the owner. They will take the
  sample from you, you are their customer.
