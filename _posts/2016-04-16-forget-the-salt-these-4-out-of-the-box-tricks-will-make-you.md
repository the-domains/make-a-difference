  Do not call restaurants at random. - Find specific restaurants that might need
  your product and target those.If you already sell to other restaurants, let
  the chef know. - Name names. Knowing that you sell to other restaurants makes
  us more comfortable in dealing with you.Find out the chef’s and owner’s names
  - The chef is the person who usually makes the decisions on what to buy. These
  people are frequently the same person in small restaurants.Visit or call on a
  slow day (Tuesday or Wednesday – in the mid afternoon.) - Do not call over
  lunch, dinner or on Fridays or Saturdays.Take a sample - You need to get your
  product in the mouth of the chef. Go to the restaurant with a sample of your
  product, a small sample, preferably ready to eat.Sell Flavour - chefs want
  flavour. They know it is hard to make great tasting food without amazing
  ingredientsIf your product requires cooking, take you product cooked – do not
  season or flavour it, but a little salt is OK. Remember, you are not selling a
  dish, you are selling an ingredient, and the chef need to taste what you are
  selling, not taste what s/he can do with it.Try and understand your market and
  their needs. Small high-end restaurants need small amounts of specialty
  products. High volume casual are going to need large amounts of cost effective
  product.Most chefs do not want the bulk of their products on Saturday. We need
  the products in the restaurant Wednesday or Thursday so we can prep them for
  our busiest days.If all else fails, make a reservation and take a sample of
  you product. Go in for dinner (on a slow day) and ask to speak to the owner.
  They will take the sample from you, you are their customer.
