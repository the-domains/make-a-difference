<article style=""><h1>Does Local Firm Ownership Matter?</h1><p> Study: Locally owned small firms increase per capita income</p></article>

I am very excited about a new study entitled "[Does Local Firm Ownership Matter?][0]" by David Flemming and Stephan Goetz.

Their study clearly shows that if you want to increase per capita incomes, the only kind of business that does that is resident-owned small businesses. This is one of the first papers that clearly connects local business with measurable economic development benefits.

In the words of the authors:

_"Subject to the caveat that the 2000-2007 period was unique in American economic history, results presented are remarkably robust in terms of the positive link between small firms that are locally owned and per capita income growth. Medium and larger firms appear to have the opposite effect, especially when they are not locally owned. These include big-boxes as well as other chain and nonchain operations that are owned by individuals who are not also residents of the community. Although these types of firms may offer opportunities for jobs, as well as job growth over time, they do so at the cost of reduced local economic growth, as measured by income. Small-sized firms owned by residents are optimal if the policy objective is to maximize income growth rates."_
