<article style=""><h1>Food Security Matters</h1><p>Food security is an important concept and can be looked at three ways: Household food security – in our country, household food insecurity is usually a result of poverty; Regional food security – insecurity is usually an issue of lack of farmers, or infrastructure to support a regional food system; National food security – a country’s ability to feed itself – this insecurity results from either a lack of farmers, or farmers do not grow diverse crops, everyone grows corn, canola or wheat for the export market, and over dependence on food imports. I like to use this video to explain national food security. (Watch for the dancing cows.) </p></article>
