We may try to eat healthy, or organic, or read labels to ensure we don’t get too much sodium. But we usually don’t understand that how we eat and where we dine or buy our groceries is a huge opportunity to have a very positive impact on us and on our community. </p><p>There are numerous benefits to a healthy local food system. Local food is fresher, picked just before being sold. Smaller scale growers can select more varieties of vegetables and fruits to grow, resulting in diverse selection. Local Food often taste better and it is much easier to get kids to eat vegetables that taste great. </p><p>The most significant opportunity for local food is the economic benefits to our community. These benefits are far reaching and touch our urban and rural communities and the thousands of people that work in our food industry. </p><p>To fully realize the opportunity we have, we need to understand some basic things about our food system. Our entire food system has many pieces, these pieces work together to get our food from the people that grow it or make it to the people that eat it. </p><p>Some of the pieces of our food system include: farmers &amp; other primary producers, food processors, distributors, retailers, and food service. </p><p>Within our large food system, there are two parallel systems. A local food system and a global food system – each of which have different costs and benefits. </p><p>We have local farmers, food processors, distributors, retailers and restaurants and we have global farmers, food processors, distributors, retailers and restaurants. An easy way to identify local and global is by asking ourselves: Is this business just in my community, or is it spread across our country, North America, or the world. </p><p>Our goal should be ensuring these two pieces work together to ensure we have the best of both systems: </p><ul><li>a diverse, healthy and abundant diet</li><li>reliable and affordable access to food</li><li>maximum economic impact for food dollars spent in our community </li></ul><p>The dollars we spend in our local food system work much harder for our local economy. Emerging research is clearly demonstrating that the economic impact is significantly higher for our community compared to our global food system. </p><p>The average Canadian farmers has moved from an average income in the mid 1970s of about $33,000 to losses of $10,000 per year in 2007. </p><p>In 2007, Alberta consumers spent $9.9 billion dollars in supermarkets and grocery store and 6.6 billion dollars in food service and drinking establishments. </p><blockquote><p>A study in Puget Sound looked at the impacts of shifting our food dollars from the Global Food system to the local food system. “The report describes the dollar flows and economic linkages of food-related businesses in the Central Puget Sound region of Washington State. The analysis shows that locally directed spending by consumers more than doubles the number of dollars circulating among businesses in the community. This means that a shift of 20% of our food dollars into locally directed spending would result in a nearly half billion dollar annual income increase in King County alone and twice that in the Central Puget Sound region.” </p></blockquote><p>How can we make Alberta’s $17.5 billion dollars of food spending work harder for our community? We can shift more of our food spending to our local food system. </p><p>How can we shift some of our foods spending to our local food system? There are hundreds of ways, but here are a few of the easiest ones: </p><blockquote><ul><li>Visit the farmers market and buy your groceries </li></ul><ul><li>Find a farmer and buy direct from a farmer </li></ul><ul><li>Dine in independent local restaurants </li></ul><ul><li>Become familiar with local brands, we have hundreds </li></ul><ul><li>Visit neighborhood bakeries Find an independent meat shops </li></ul><ul><li>Find a local coffee shop </li></ul><ul><li>Find a local coffee roaster </li></ul><ul><li>Have local food delivered to your door </li></ul><ul><li>Find a local beer you like or a local wine. </li></ul><ul><li>Visit a local and independent wine shop </li></ul><ul><li>Localize imports by buying them at a local independent retailer </li></ul><ul><li>Talk about the great local food experiences you find – often the challenge for local businesses is getting the word out </li></ul></blockquote><p>Currently Local food makes us a small portion of our food spending, likely less than 10%. If we were successful in shifting an additional 20%, it would change the way our community looks.</p></div></section><section id="3" class="Section Section--article color-bg color-title color-text w-100p p-1  colors-vibrant colors-global " data-reactid="24"><div class="Component max-w-768px m-a pos-r" data-reactid="25"><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/3c0d7776-7eaf-47b5-b0b5-24a8b2db0dcf.jpg" alt="" title="" /><p>Everyone
has different reasons for buying at the farmers market, or going to a local
bakery or meat shop.</p><p>Here are 10 that resonate with me.</p><p></p><p>1 - Freshness - products picked and grown close to home are usually fresher</p><p></p><p>2 - Increased Flavour - local growers don’t need to ship their products long distances, that mean they can grow varieties that have more flavour but might not be good for storing or shipping</p><p></p><p>3 - Diversity of products - ever been to a grocery store that had half a dozen different kinds of cauliflower or 20 different potatoes? Me neither - but you can see them at the market all the time</p><p></p><p>4 - Increased Local Economic Impact - shopping with a local business (including farmers! - yes they are businesses) can significantly increase the economic impact of your food purchase to our community</p><p></p><p>5 - Increased Regional Food Security - when we buy local food, farmers and processors can increase how much they grow or make, this increases the level of food production in our region. That is a good thing!</p><p></p><p>6 - Shorter Supply Chain = less shipping and less shipping means less pollution from trucks or ships or airplanes</p><p></p><p>7 - You know the Environmental Standards of the producing county - Alberta and Canada have high environmental standards for food producing and growing and food processing has to meet rigorous regulation. That is not the case in other parts of the world, including countries that Canada imports food from</p><p></p><p>8 - Community building opportunities around food and food culture - farmers markets, food festivals, long table dinners, independent restaurants and food trucks all help provide some “flavour” to our community. Our food culture helps make our community unique and special</p><p></p><p>9 - Diverse ownership makes the industry competitive - if you have dozens of businesses competing for your dollars, it makes the industry more competitive. (yes farms are businesses)</p><p></p><p></p><p>10 - Local owners or farmers can be held accountable for
business practices - if you have a question or concern, the business owner is
available, and often the person you are dealing with, so you can get questions
answered and have any concerns addressed</p></div></section></div><section id="4" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-vibrant colors-global " data-reactid="26"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="27"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="28"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="29"><span data-reactid="30"><!-- react-empty: 31 --><h2 data-reactid="32"><a data-reactid="33">make a difference</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="34"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="35"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="36"></div></div></div><div data-reactid="37"></div></section></div></div>
